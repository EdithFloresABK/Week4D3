# Week4D3
## Part 1
Challenge:

Firstly, read ahead into the next chapter's challenges to understand the overarching Multithreading challenge

Follow the provided videos in this chapter, recreating the hello world example code, and reviewing how threading can be used in the maze game

Attempt the small challenges shown along the way to familiarise yourself with threading, before moving into the next chapter





## Part2
Challenge:

Watch the videos and then create an input thread so the world state can update independent of the user input

Use the documentation as demonstrated where needed

Flag any other candidates in your code for improvement using multithreading, and implement them if possible
